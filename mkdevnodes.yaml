Summary    : Fast MAKEDEV replacement
Description: |
        A replacement for MAKEDEV. Instead of parsing hard-coded text files, mkdevnodes uses the information provided in sysfs to generate device nodes with mknod() as needed, as well as a few base device nodes that always need to be present. Mkdevnodes is thus extremely fast, as it doesn not need to read and/or parse text files from the root filesystem.
